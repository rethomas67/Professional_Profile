# Professional ProfileAdd commentMore actions

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Description

Currently, two official plugins are available:
My Professional Proile is a project which uses React, GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data. Requests communicate with the Apollo Server. The deployment uses MongoDB Atlas and Heroku.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Installation

Just run npm install at your command prompt. The main packages are Vite, Apollo Client, Apollo Server. Setup a database and connection. This project uses MongoDb.

## Usage

Upon entering the application, the user is presented with a header, content, and footer.

The header contains an image of me along with menu items the user can navigate to.

The Navigation Item links are About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume. When a link is clicked, the selected link is highlighted and the corresponding content is displayed.

The About Me page is the default page with a photo of myself and a bio about myself.

The Portfolio Page displays projects I developed. The user can launch the application of the project by clicking on the image. A link to the deployed project to GitHub is also available.

Th Contact page allows the user to enter into the fields Name, Email, and Message. The user can submit the message to MongoDb. The page contains a button to view all messages as well. Error notifications are presented if incorrect or incomplete data is entered.

The Resume page has a link to my Resume and a list of my proficiencies.

The Footer contains links to Github, and LinkedIn.
